							<p className='tab-heading'>Suggested topic areas</p>
				<p className="tab-paragraph">The theme for Kernelcon 2024, is “AI” (note, this does not, exclusively, mean "artificial intelligence"). Accordingly, those that wish to tailor a talk to the theme or require a broad topic to start the creative engine toward a new talk, "AI" is your starting point. Consider Artificial Intelligence, but also Audio Interfaces, All Inclusive talks, maybe event DIY Astronomical Interferometers. However, adopting the theme is not a hard requirement.  Do not let these directions limit your creativity, interpretation, or the subject of your talk.</p>
				<p className="tab-paragraph">Kernelcon submissions should focus on topics that are of interest to the security and hacking communities. The list below is meant as a guideline, not an exhaustive list.</p>
				<p className="tab-paragraph">
				<ul className="real-bullet-list">
					<li>Hacking of Software/Hardware</li>
					<li>Incident Response</li>
					<li>Operational Security</li>
					<li>Computing Hardware Security, Repurposing, Designing/Building</li>
					<li>Technology Policy and Politics (yep, we're willing to go there)</li>
					<li>Security Education</li>
					<li>Security and Hacking Capture-the-Flag Topics</li>
					<li>Security Automation</li>
					<li>Digital Forensics</li>
					<li>Bug Bounties</li>
					<li>Application Security</li>
					<li>Secure Development Practices / DevSecOps / SecDevOps</li>
					<li>Security Aspects of Cloud Computing</li>
					<li>Practical Security</li>
					<li>Machine Learning (securing, and using for security)</li>
					<li>War Stories, Histories, Scientific Advancement, Trade, etc. of Kernels</li>
					<li>Security Metrics (Inform Risk Analysis, Identify Priorities, Measure Progress, etc)</li>
					<li>Risk Management</li>
					<li>BeyondCorp / Zerotrust models in practice</li>
					<li>Privacy and Anonymity</li>
					<li>Identity & Access Management</li>
					<li>Focused Security Research (Visualization, IoT, Vehicles, Toys, Web apps, etc)</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p className="tab-paragraph">If your talk doesn't fit precisely into one of these areas, the theme, but you still think is a good fit, please submit it for consideration! The suggested topics are meant only to provide some direction, not as a strict pedantic gate through which all submissions must pass.</p>

				
				<p className='tab-heading'>Conference format</p>
							<p className="tab-paragraph">Kernelcon 2024 will have two, concurrent main tracks, and talks should fit into a 60 (FULL) or 20 (SHORT) minute timeslot (meaning a 50 or 15 minute presentation is expected). As one might expect, presenters will be positioned at the front of a hotel conference area, and will present using typical conference equipment.</p>

				<p className='tab-heading'>Speaker Benefits</p>
							<p className="tab-paragraph">Speakers receive complimentary admission to Kernelcon and will be recognized as a speaker via a special “SPEAKER” badge. Speakers also have the option of attending an exclusive speaker party preceding the conference. Details will be sent to accepted speakers following acceptance notification.</p>
				<p className="tab-paragraph">For each FULL talk, the speakers may additionally select one of:</p>
				<p className="tab-paragraph">
					<ul className="real-bullet-list">
					<li>2 additional “HACKER” registrations</li>
					<li>$200 donation to the EFF or Hackers for Charity</li>
					<li>$200 honorarium</li>
					<li>Please reinvest into making Kernelcon even better next year</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p className="tab-paragraph">We may also tentatively accept backup/alternate talks which will not be guaranteed a speaking slot, but will receive admission in order to be ready to present in the event they are needed.</p>

				<p className='tab-heading'>Review process</p>
				<p className="tab-paragraph">Our review process is not as formal as some academic conferences. However, submissions are considered confidential and are not shared outside of the Technical Program Committee. Every submission is reviewed by multiple committee members and weighed for inclusion in the program. TPC Committee members are selected for the ability to provide valuable reviews, handle sensitive information, and remain fair, impartial, and consistent in the review process. Ultimately the committee informs the TPC Chair(s) who set the technical portion of the program that is married with the rest of Kernelcon agenda.</p>

				<p className='tab-heading'>How to submit</p>
				<p className="tab-paragraph">Speakers should submit directly (e.g. no PR representatives are permitted).</p>

				<p className="tab-paragraph">Information you'll need to have handy for your submission:
					<ul className="real-bullet-list no-bullets">
					<li><input className="fake-checkbox" type="checkbox"/>Speaker name(s)</li>
					<li><input className="fake-checkbox" type="checkbox"/>Speaker Name(s), Pseudonym(s), or handle(s) </li>

					</ul>

				</p>
				<p className="tab-paragraph">Incomplete or misformatted submissions greatly reduce the likelihood of your talk being accepted.</p>
				<p className="tab-paragraph">Novel, new, on-topic talks receive the most preference. Submissions by first-time presenters are not discounted in any way. Quite the opposite! First-timers are whole-heartedly encouraged to submit. Blatant vendor pitches, recycled talks, presentations on well-known topics that are *not* depicted as 101 or intro, are unlikely to be accepted. We expect presentations that are considerate, planned, thought-out, and delivered well. All talks are considered on their merits. Everyone, including sponsors, internet legends, cultural icons, and Dave Kennedy must submit just like all other speakers.</p>
				
				<p className="tab-paragraph">For 2024 we've moved to a form based CFP submission system rather than the email and PDF based system used prior.  Such a system allows for more automation on our end, but also addresses some feedback we've heard from authors, such as the ability to edit submissions.</p>
